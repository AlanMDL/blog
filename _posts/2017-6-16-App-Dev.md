title: An App for a special occasion!
---

As I was working through some app development tutorials on [Udacity](www.udacity.com), I thought of of a fun app idea to make. A greeting card app for my cousin who is graduating from UC Santa Barbara this weekend. So I got to work on creating it and this is what I ended up making in around 20 minutes or rough work. I decided to google a funny graduation meme that embodies the mindset of most students who are graduating. Not bad for a quick throw up of views and lines of code. I also plan on adding an onscreen particle effects that will follow your finger as you scroll through the screen.
